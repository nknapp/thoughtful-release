### CLI options

Calling `thoughtful --help` will print a command-line reference:

{{{exec 'bin/thoughtful.js --help'}}}

Please refer to the [man/thoughtful.md](command line reference) of this project for 
details about the commands. 

#### Supporting the git workflow

You can enforce the above workflow using git-hooks and `Thoughtful`. Have a look at 
[the git-workflow](docs/git-workflow.md)-document.
