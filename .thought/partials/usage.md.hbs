### CLI options

# NodeJS compatibility notes

This package will always support the latest version of NodeJS and as well as
the current LTS version. In the future, it will not be considered a breaking
change to drop support of a pre-LTS version of NodeJS.

Calling `thoughtful --help` will print a command-line reference:

{{{exec 'bin/thoughtful.js --help'}}}

Please refer to the [command line reference](man/thoughtful.md) of this project for 
details about the commands. 

#### Supporting the git workflow

You can enforce the above workflow using git-hooks and `Thoughtful`. Have a look at 
[the git-workflow](docs/git-workflow.md)-document.

### Generate changelog

You can use the command `thoughtful-release -o -a` as a version script in the `package.json`.
On version bumps, a CHANGELOG.md is then automatically generated from git commits.
Before it is commited to the git repository, an editor is opened to let you review and modify the changelog.

The editor-command is taken from environment variables 

* `${THOUGHTFUL_CHANGELOG_EDITOR}`
* with a fallback to `${EDITOR}`
* with a fallback to `vi`.
