People like **substack** encourage you to divide 
the functionality of large monolithic modules into reasonable parts and publish each of those as module on 
there own. That's what I did when I separated {{npm 'swagger-to-html'}} into {{npm 'bootprint'}} and three
template modules and then extracted multiple modules (i.e. the `customize-`family) from `bootprint`, so that
it was easy to implement {{npm 'thought'}} on this basis as well. 

The problem is, that now there are 10 modules to maintain instead of just one. The overhead for releasing new 
versions is about the same for each package. This module is a toolkit to make the following tasks easier, thus
increasing the package quality and reducing the workload for a release:

* **Generate changelog**: Changelog generation is inspired by the [Ghost git workflow](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Git-workflow)
* **QA git hooks**: (not yet implemented) Mechanism to register a pre-commit and a pre-push hook so to
    avoid working on the master branch and to ensure the code-style of the project
* **Git workflow**: (not yet implemented) Tools for creating a new branch and cleaning up the history before merging to master
* **Release workflow**: (not yet implemented) A command to run tests, generate changelog, bump versions and publish to npm,
    similar to the {{npm 'release-tools'}}-package
